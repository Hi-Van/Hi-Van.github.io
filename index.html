                            <p><b>UCONN STAMFORD ENGINEER MAJORS GROUP | FOUNDER</b> I am the founder of a body of students who collaborate with each other to reduces the stresses of course work and academia. I noticed the reason many engineering students were lacking a social network and livelihood was due to a lack of time outside of academia. In order to solve that problem, I founded this group. We work to give engineering students the opportunity to live a healthy social life and truly have the college experience, instead of burying their lives in books</p>
                            <p><b>SUMMER OF SHIPPING | CORE TEAM & FRONTEND ENGINEER</b> Taking part in SoS, it allowed me to grow exponentially quicker than if I confined myself to my univeristy campus. In SoS, I was exposed to many others who were far more experienced than me and connected to mentors who taught me industry standards and techniques. I am thankful to become part of this group as a core team member and frontend engineer, as this allowed me to explore many different technologies and avenues to grow my skills. it has, without a doubt, been a great substitute to an internship in the Summer of 2020</p>

                            <p><b>A NERD</b> I've grown to love learning and building new things. I also like going to my friends lectures for fun</p>
                            <p><b>A WEED</b> Just name an anime and there's an 80% chance I've seen it. I can also give great reccomendations</p>
                            <p><b>SOCIAL</b> As the founder of UConn Stamford Engineering Majors, I often reach out and network for new members, giving them the opportunity to experience more of a social life, this naturally turned some of these members into my close friends. Also, as a member of the group, I have more time to spend with my friends or on my own interests. I love hanging out with my friends and I'm grateful that I can do so</p>
                            <p><b>RESOURCEFUL</b> Oftentimes, I learn things in an obsessive fashion. I usually become so encompassed in the material that I outpace the curriculum. Therefore, the professor doesn't have the time to address my questions during lecture. So I just try to find it out on my own</p>
