                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>People say that college will change you, and by all accounts it changed me. Ever since enrolling in college, I became a massive nerd. Outside of Software Engineering and Development, I still like to learn and build things. One of my favorite things to do was to sneak into my friends lectures and see if I could answer any of their questions. I remember sneaking into my friend's mathematics class and actually answering one of the problems correctly, and I got extra credit too. I had to tell the professor I wasn't enrolled in the class though. I also like "nerding out" with my friends over stuff like Calc 1, Physics, and Biology. Don't get me wrong, I still hate Calc 2. Otherwise, I enjoy more normal hobbies, like dancing, being social, and working out.</p>

                    <h2>Why Software Engineering</h2>
                    <p>I first started coding in my junior year of high school. It was difficult, to say the least. I ended up sticking with it into my senior year with both AP CS Applications and AP CS Principles. When I got to college I had two choices, Software Engineering or Medical field. I took introduction to general chemistry my first semester..... and I hated it, so I chose Software Engineering.</p>

                    <h2>Who Am I</h2>
                    <p>I'm the weird kid from high school. I never really had a lot of friends. I was never out with friends, never talking to anyone, I wasn't even that smart. I was alone, and that was becuase people really didn't like me. It wasn't that I was too nerdy, I wasn't smart enough for that. It wasn't becuase I was too mean, I always tried to be nice to others. It was becuase I was different. They liked watching Netflix shows, I liked watching Anime on Crunchyroll. They liked playing basketball and football, I liked soccer. They talked about going cross country or international for vacation. I talked about visiting my family. Since I was different, I got hurt. I ended up becoming resentful becuase of it. In all honesty, I was jealous at the time. I wanted lots of friends and I wanted to be accepted for who I was, but I wasn't. So I did the next best thing. I took the pain, used it to improve myself and left everyone else in the dust. Now, I watch them. The things they criticized me for in the past are becoming popular. Now, they're starting to copy who I was years ago. Yet here I am, waiting to see if they change their minds once again. Am I still resentful? A little bit. But I know who my friends are. I know what I like, and who I am. I am the weird kid, and I'm proud of it.</p>
