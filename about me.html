                    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>People say that college will change you, and by all accounts it changed me. Ever since enrolling in college, I became a massive nerd. Outside of Software Engineering and Development, I still like to learn and build things. One of my favorite things to do was to sneak into my friends lectures and see if I could answer any of their questions. I remember sneaking into my friend's mathematics class and actually answering one of the problems correctly, and I got extra credit too. I had to tell the professor I wasn't enrolled in the class though. I also like "nerding out" with my friends over stuff like Calc 1, Physics, and Biology. Don't get me wrong, I still hate Calc 2. Otherwise, I enjoy more normal hobbies, like dancing, being social, and working out.</p>

                    <h2>Why Software Engineering</h2>
                    <p>I first started coding in my junior year of high school. It was difficult, to say the least. I ended up sticking with it into my senior year with both AP CS Applications and AP CS Principles. When I got to college I had two choices, Software Engineering or Medical field. I took introduction to general chemistry my first semester..... and I hated it, so I chose Software Engineering.</p>

                    <h2>Who Am I</h2>
                    <p>I'm a Computer Science student at UConn. I usually like to go by the nickname "Van", but sometimes I get called by my first name by those who knew me since I was little. I think I'm pretty much the average computer sicence major. I like watching anime, I play videogames, and I like learning and building things. I wasn't always like this. Everyone says that people change in college, and I became a massive nerd compared to who I was in high school. I used to despise coming to class becuase everything was boring and it was unapplicable. When I got to college, I began learning different areas of engineering and eventually I grew to learn and build things as a hobby. I guess there's nothing that really stands out about me besides that fact that I like to be social. Oftentimes, I don't enjoy doing work by myself, so I often lead groups in order to get work done in a more effecient and timely mannner. that way both the group and I can enjoy more time to have fun and have social lives outside of lecture. In fact, this approach worked so well, I'm the original founder the CS major discord for the class of 2023 at my regional campus. In the end, I don't feel as if I'm "that guy" becuase I'm not so different from the average CS student. I just happen to be a little more social and I grew to love building and learning new things becuase of Software Engineering.</p>
